# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create fact_fhir_observations_view_v1 materialized view
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement materialized view for observations with components and reference ranges using enhanced aggregation patterns
# Details:
Create materialized view joining observations with observation_components, observation_categories, observation_performers, observation_reference_ranges, observation_interpretations, observation_notes, observation_derived_from, and observation_members. Use MAX/MIN for vital signs pivoting as shown in PRD example. Aggregate components as JSON, include reference ranges, and handle observation relationships. Implement the blood pressure systolic/diastolic pattern from PRD specifications.

# Test Strategy:
Test view creation, validate vital signs pivoting logic, verify component aggregation accuracy, and ensure reference ranges are properly associated with observations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze observations and 8 related tables structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive analysis of the observations main table (44 columns) and all 8 related tables to understand data relationships and aggregation requirements
### Details:
Analyze observations table structure including all 44 columns. Document relationships with observation_components, observation_categories, observation_performers, observation_reference_ranges, observation_interpretations, observation_notes, observation_derived_from, and observation_members tables. Identify primary and foreign keys, data types, and cardinality of relationships. Review existing data patterns for vital signs, especially blood pressure measurements with systolic/diastolic components.

## 2. Design view with MAX/MIN vital signs pivoting logic [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Design the materialized view structure implementing MAX/MIN functions for vital signs pivoting as specified in PRD, particularly for blood pressure patterns
### Details:
Design SQL structure for vital signs pivoting using MAX(CASE WHEN component_code = 'systolic' THEN value END) and MIN(CASE WHEN component_code = 'diastolic' THEN value END) patterns. Define the main SELECT statement structure with proper GROUP BY clauses. Plan the pivoting logic for common vital signs: blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Ensure the design accommodates both single-value and multi-component observations.

## 3. Implement component JSON aggregations [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop JSON aggregation logic for observation components including value, unit, and interpretation data
### Details:
Implement JSON_ARRAYAGG or similar functions to aggregate observation_components data into structured JSON arrays. Each component should include: code, display, value, unit, interpretation, and reference range. Handle numeric, string, and coded value types. Ensure proper NULL handling and data type conversions. Create nested JSON structures that preserve component relationships and ordering.

## 4. Add reference ranges and interpretations aggregation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement aggregation logic for reference ranges and interpretations, ensuring proper association with observations and components
### Details:
Join observation_reference_ranges table and aggregate reference range data (low, high, normal range text) as JSON. Include observation_interpretations data with proper code mappings (H, L, N, etc.). Ensure reference ranges are correctly associated with specific components when applicable. Handle age-specific and context-specific reference ranges. Aggregate interpretation codes and display text using LISTAGG or JSON functions.

## 5. Handle observation relationships and complete view [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Implement observation relationship handling for derived_from and members tables, and finalize the complete materialized view
### Details:
Join observation_derived_from to track parent-child observation relationships. Handle observation_members for panel/battery observations. Implement proper aggregation for observation_performers, observation_categories, and observation_notes. Add all remaining columns including status, effective dates, issued date, and method. Ensure proper NULL handling for optional relationships. Complete the CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statement with all joins and aggregations.

## 6. Test vital signs pivoting and component aggregation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Thoroughly test the materialized view focusing on vital signs pivoting accuracy and component aggregation integrity
### Details:
Create test queries to validate blood pressure systolic/diastolic pivoting returns correct MAX/MIN values. Test component JSON aggregation for multi-component observations (CBC panels, metabolic panels). Verify reference ranges are properly associated with observations and components. Test observation relationship tracking (derived_from, members). Validate performance with sample data and ensure no data loss during aggregation. Document any edge cases or data quality issues discovered during testing.
