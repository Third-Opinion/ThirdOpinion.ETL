# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create fact_fhir_procedures_view_v1 materialized view
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement materialized view for procedures with code codings and identifier aggregation
# Details:
Create materialized view joining procedures with procedure_code_codings and procedure_identifiers. Aggregate procedure codes, include performer information, procedure dates, and status. Handle procedure relationships, outcomes, and complications. Use JSON_PARSE for coded elements and LISTAGG for multiple code codings per procedure.

# Test Strategy:
Test view creation, validate procedure code aggregation, verify date handling for performed procedures, and ensure proper status and outcome tracking.
