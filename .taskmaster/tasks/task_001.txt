# Task ID: 1
# Title: Analyze existing table schemas and relationships
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Review all DDL files in ddl_exports/ to understand table structures, relationships, and data patterns for the 8 required FHIR entities
# Details:
Use the Read tool to examine key DDL files for care_plans, conditions, diagnostic_reports, document_references, medication_requests, observations, practitioners, and procedures. Document primary keys, foreign keys, and relationship patterns. Map out the normalized table structure for each entity to understand how to join tables in materialized views. Create a comprehensive data dictionary showing table relationships and key fields needed for fact views.

# Test Strategy:
Validate table relationships by running test queries against each entity's tables. Confirm primary/foreign key relationships and identify any missing tables or unexpected schema variations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review DDL export directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the ddl_exports/ directory to understand what table schemas are available
### Details:


## 2. Analyze FHIR entity table schemas [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review table definitions for the 8 FHIR entities: care_plans, conditions, diagnostic_reports, document_references, medication_requests, observations, practitioners, procedures
### Details:


## 3. Identify foreign key relationships and dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Map out how the FHIR entities relate to each other through foreign keys and reference tables
### Details:


## 4. Document data patterns from existing views [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Study the existing fact_fhir_patients_view_v1 and fact_fhir_encounters_view_v1 to understand naming conventions, JSON aggregation patterns, and materialized view structure
### Details:


## 5. Create schema analysis summary document [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compile findings into a comprehensive analysis document that will guide implementation of the remaining materialized views
